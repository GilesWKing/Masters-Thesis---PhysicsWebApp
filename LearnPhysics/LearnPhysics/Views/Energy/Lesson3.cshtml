                Take your mind back to the algebra opening - each symbol is just a placeholder for a number.
                Whilst the equations may look intimidating, just remember the numbers are hidden amongst the questions.

            <p>
                When we combine the two components (mass and speed) together, it's easy to imagine moving something
                heavy at a high speed requires a lot of energy, and something with very little mass at a high speed
                requires a lot less energy.
            </p>
            <p>We can show this mathematically.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The average weight of a midsize car in the UK is 1600 kilograms (1.6 tons). We will keep the mass the same
                    and change the value of speed to compare the differences in the kinetic energy of an object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whilst it's stationary (0 metres per second), it would have no kinetic energy because anything multiplied
                    by zero is still zero.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The speed limit in a UK town is 30 mph (13 metres per second).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The speed limit on a UK motorway is 70 mph (31 metres per second).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The speed for an instant ban is in excess of 100 mph (45 metres per second).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will now put these numbers into the equation with an explanation below.</p>

                <strong>Mass.</strong> Just like kinetic energy, the objects we look at have
                <a href="javascript://" style="color:black; font-weight:bold;" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
                   title="Often confused with weight, mass is how much matter something is made up of.">
                    mass
                </a>

                   title="This is the standard unit for measuring mass. A kilogram is 1000 grams and often abbreviated

                    kilograms
                </a>
                (kg). There's a common misconception that a heavy object falls faster than a light object - a heavy object
                certainly has more G.P.E. than a light energy. In reality, everything falls at the same rate and therefore
                we don't need to use speed in this equation, just mass.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Height.</strong> This is an obviously important factor - the higher an object has to fall, the more
                energy it is going to have in it's G.P.E. store. Height is measured in metre's, and this is measured from
                the Earth's surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Gravitational field strength.</strong> The Earth (and other large celestial bodies) all have a
                gravitational field, within which a force exists that pulls objects towards it. Gravity on Earth is a
                <a href="javascript://" style="color:black; font-weight:bold;" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
                   title="A constant is as it sounds - constant. This means a number that we can use and it shouldn't change.">
                    constant
                </a>. The Earth's gravitational field strength is 9.81 N/kg, which means for every kilogram of an object's mass, it
                has a force of 9.81 Newtons pulling it to the ground. This is approximately the force required to hold up a
                10kg dumb bell a metre in the air.

                When we combine the three components (mass, gravitational field strength and height) together, it's easy to
                imagine that the higher you climb, for example up a tree or a building, the the harder your fall would be.
            </p>
            <p>We can again show this mathematically.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The average weight of a man in the UK is 85kg, and we know the Earth's gravitational strength is 9.81 N/kg.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let's imagine a man standing in a tree at 5 metres height.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Secondly we'll compare that to the G.P.E. of the same man standing on Big Ben at approximately 100 metres (96...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, we can take Big Ben (~100 metres) to the Moon and see what the difference would be up there.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will now put these numbers into the equation with an explanation below.</p>

            <p>
                So from these results, the same mass dropped on Earth increases in energy based upon it's height above the Earth's
                surface. To demonstrate this, there is one final worked example below of an average man at 100 metres height above
                the Moon. See below.

                The Moon is a lot smaller than Earth - it has a smaller mass. While the gravitational field strength of Earth is
                9.81 N/kg, the Moon is a lot less at 1.6 N/kg. Jupiter however is so large, it has a gravitational field strength
                two and a half times of Earth at 25 N/kg. After working out the Moon, you can apply the same method to that of
                Jupiter if you wish.
