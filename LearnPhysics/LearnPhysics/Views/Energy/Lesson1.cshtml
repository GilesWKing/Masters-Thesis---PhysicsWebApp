                    The person can then stand still while the ball continues to travel because of the energy the ball still retains.

            <p>
                Good question! <u>Energy cannot be created or destroyed</u>. It moves from one
                form of energy to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The principle thing to take away is that the energy we use is not made by us.
                It must have already existed from somewhere, and we are just changing it from one form
                to another that is useful to us.

                    Most of the energy available to us on the planet has come from the Sun, which showers us with energy everyday.

                    Life forms have exploited the energy from the sun. We rely on these organisms to give us energy as well.
