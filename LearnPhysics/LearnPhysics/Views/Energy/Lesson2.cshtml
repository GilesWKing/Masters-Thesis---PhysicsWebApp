            <p>
                When we talk about energy, we often say it is ‘burnt’, especially when talking about exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not actually true; remember in Lesson 1 we said energy cannot be created or destroyed. Instead it moves from one ‘store’ to another ‘store’.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good example in the case of exercise would be the human body acting as a store of energy. Energy is stored in the;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    liver;
                </li>
                <li>
                    muscles;
                </li>
                <li>
                    and fats.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As you exercise, your muscles are doing work, your body is getting warmer, breathing becomes heavier, the heart is beating faster and you are moving.
                The body begins to use sugars in the blood as energy, then moves on to stored energy in the muscles and eventually converts fat cells into a form of useable energy.

                Physicists explain this in a slightly different way. There are nine different ‘stores’ of energy. The ones explained in the exercise example above are chemical,
                thermal, and kinetic energy stores.

            <p><strong> Nuclear, light, gravity and elastic energy</strong></p>

            <br />
            <p>
                Other common examples are nuclear energy, light energy, gravitational potential
                energy and elastic potential energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nuclear is fairly self-explanatory; we have power stations that harness nuclear
                power sources to generate electricity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Light energy is usually given off by objects that are already very hot. The Sun
                is obviously very hot, but so are lightbulbs and even 'red-hot' metals when
                they're placed in a blacksmiths forge.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next two are called ‘potential’ because you can store the energy that may
                never get used. For instance, an apple growing high up on a tree has gravity
                pulling it down, but until the apple falls from the tree, that energy isn’t used.
                The same can be said for you going to the top of a skyscraper; you contain potential
                energy, but by going back down to the ground floor, that energy is reduced.
            </p>

            <p>
                The same can be said for elastic potential – winding up an elastic band stores energy
                but unless it is let go, the energy is still stored inside the elastic band.
            </p>

            <p><strong> Less common stores of energy</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                There are other stores of energy that we may interact with on a daily basis but never really acknowledge, or are more abstract.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are electrostatic and magnetic energy stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electrostatic energy is commonly known as a spark of electricity, such as when you touch a supermarket trolley and get a ‘static’
                shock, or when lightning occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common knowledge around magnets is that opposites poles attract, whilst like poles repel. Forcing like poles together requires
                energy, and therefore magnetic energy is stored. The same can be said when pulling attracting poles apart – they store magnetic
                energy to try and pull them together again.
