                Let's recap lesson 1 and 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lesson 1 said ‘Energy cannot be created or destroyed’ and that energy is used to move things or heat things up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lesson 2 said ‘Energy can be stored’ and outlined the 9 different stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the building blocks for Lesson 3 – the

                of energy.

            <p><strong>Conservation of energy</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Conservation of energy says that <b>'energy cannot be created or destroyed, but transferred from one store to another'</b>.
                This means that the amount of energy used to do work, is always transferred into another store of energy.

                diagram is a great way of demonstrating this. The diagram below demonstrates the amount of energy going into, and
                coming out of a lightbulb (100 J). See if you can figure out how the diagram works.
            <p />
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="card bg-light mb-3">

            </div>
            <p>
                100 joules of electrical potential (or electrostatic) energy is going into the light bulb. We know that turning
                a lightbulb on creates light and heat energy. 25 J of heat energy and 75 J of light energy is the original 100 J
                being transferred into other forms of energy. It really is as simple as that.

            <br />
            <p>
                In this instance, the light bulb is what we call the
                <a href="#" style="color:black; font-weight:bold;" title="System" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top"
                   data-content="A system is a fancy word for saying 'something we want to analyse'. A system can be an object like a light bulb,

            <p>
                In an <b>open</b> system, we look at how energy moves into and out of the system. a good example is a cup of tea;
                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <div class="card bg-light mb-3">
                        <div class="card-body">

                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a cup of tea <b>loses energy</b>, it gets cold. This energy dissipates into its surroundings where the
                        energy is lower.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cup of tea doesn't regain energy by itself, unless the external temperature becomes hotter than the cup
                        of tea.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In order to <b>gain energy</b>, the cup of tea needs to be heated. This could be in a microwave or emptied
                        into a saucepan, but in both of these examples, energy needs to come from somewhere else (electricity or
                        gas) and then be transferred to the tea.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In a <b>closed</b> system, we are looking at object/s where energy cannot enter or leave the system. A thermos flask is a good example;
                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3">
                        <div class="card-body" style="width: 424px;">

                                <img src="~/images/topics/energy/lesson4/thermos-with-lining.jpg" alt="Vaccuum flask" />
                                <figcaption>Photo taken from http://physicsrahul.blogspot.com/2017/04/heat-and-temparature.html </figcaption>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Even though a vaccuum flask is closed, it's a perfect example of a closed system because very little energy can
                        escape nor enter very easily.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The energy stays inside a vaccuum flask, meaning hot drinks can stay hot (or cold drinks stay cool) for a lot
                        longer than they can inside an open system (cup).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But changing energy outside of the closed system doesn't change energy inside of the closed system. A vaccuum
                        flask on a cold day performs just as well as it would on a warm day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You would have to make the vaccum flask an open system (i.e. take the lid off) to transfer energy into or out
                        of the tea that is contained inside.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                Physicists and engineers also like to discuss efficiency. We aren't going to go into depth here, but the light bulb in
                the Sankey diagram is not 100% efficient. 100% efficiency would mean the 100 J of electrical energy would transfer into
                100 J of light energy.

                But it doesn't... It still gives out 25 J (25%) of energy as heat, which is a form of energy we ideally
                don't want from a light bulb.

            <p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                In order to think about efficiency, we need to look at the purpose of the item - when we turn a light on, what
                kind of energy do we want it to produce? Of course we want it to produce light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any energy given off as heat is therefore <b>wasted energy</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The more energy given off as light makes a light bulb more efficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The more energy given off as heat makes a light bulb less efficient (inefficient).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Efficiency is something that can be worked out in percentages - in the previous light bulb example, the bulb is
                75% efficient but in other examples, the calculations can be quite tricky. This is beyond the scope for this lesson
                but do bear in mind efficiency is the difference of <b>useful</b> versus <b>wasted</b> energy. The more efficient
                something is, the more <b>useful</b> energy we get out of it.
